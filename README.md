#Python Project
Welcome to the cliff hanger terminal shell game. 
For this game to run and to be able to interact with it, make sure you have the most recent install for python and you also have the >>pip install console-progressbar << installed as well. You will also need import random, and os. 

In this game you will have to select one of the key options and then guess on a randomly assigned price for said item. The random price range is within reason to what you could expect the item to be priced. I.E the random price that gets assigned for a coffee is a random number somewhere between 1 - 10.

To run the code and start the program, in your terminal, make sure you are in the python101_project directory, then type "python main.py"
